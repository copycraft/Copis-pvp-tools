# Copis Pvp Tools

This is a mod that plays the XP level-up sound when one of your crucial effects runs out, and adds a screen border when your health is low.

It also has a config option that lets you enable AutoGG. When enabled, it will say "gg" in chat when you kill a player or die.

This mod works on both Forge and Fabric.

If you're above High Tier 5, you shouldn't be using this. It's considered cheating in some situations, so don't use it in competitions.
